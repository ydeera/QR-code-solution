## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

> Margin collapsing occurs in three basic cases:
> 1. **Adjacent siblings**
The margins of adjacent siblings are collapsed (except when the latter sibling needs to be cleared past floats).
> 2. **No content separating parent and descendants**
If there is no border, padding, inline part, block formatting context created, or clearance to separate the margin-top of a block from the margin-top of one or more of its descendant blocks; or no border, padding, inline content, height, or min-height to separate the margin-bottom of a block from the margin-bottom of one or more of its descendant blocks, then those margins collapse. The collapsed margin ends up outside the parent.
>
> 3. **Empty blocks**
If there is no border, padding, inline content, height, or min-height to separate a block's margin-top from its margin-bottom, then its top and bottom margins collapse.

### Continued development

+ A deeper understanding of box model
+ Responsive layout
